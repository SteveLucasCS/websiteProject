					<p>Kim Meninger coaches current and aspiring executives to advance their leadership roles and reach their full potential.
					As a certified career and executive leadership development coach, Kim guides executives with a deceptively simple premise:
					Lead from where you are. In other words, with the right mindset and approach, everyone, regardless of level or title, has
					the potential to become a great leader.</p>

					<p>Kim has coached hundreds of clients and presented on career advancement and leadership topics to corporate and academic
					audiences. She is regularly sought to train, coach, and mentor current and future business leaders on the art and science
					of leadership, including strategy development, effective communication, team building and change management. In this role,
					she manages all aspects of business ownership, including strategic planning, financial strategy, marketing, and client attraction.
					Kim believes fundamentally that everyone drives their own careers.</p>

					<p>Prior to formalizing her leadership coaching expertise, she held a variety of cross-functional leadership roles in the high-tech
					industry where she interfaced with all levels and departments, both internally and externally. With EMC, she developed a broad view
					of the political and organizational forces that drive large corporate organizations and was able to successfully navigate these
					dynamics. Based on her relationship building expertise, Kim was tapped by EMC’s Inside Sales leadership to create a channel sales
					team where she coached an underperforming group of former sales associates into a crack organization of relationship managers, all
					by maximizing their inherent strengths. She earned the prestigious EMC President’s Award for her inimitable contribution to the
					organization. Thus, with credibility borne of corporate experience, training, and talent, Kim proudly works with new and veteran

			<h2>My Assurance</h2>

			<p>I currently have over 100 Certified Coaches licensed and trained to deliver my trademarked Quantum Endeavors®Coaching Engagements.
			All Quantum Endeavors® Executive Coaches have also created great success in their own careers and have invested significantly in
			their skills in coaching best practices and certifications. It is my belief that the most powerful coaching is based on this:
			“you can only coach someone to go where you have been willing to go; to do what you have been willing to risk and achieve.”
			That is the caliber of coaching that is the Quantum Endeavors, Inc. commitment to our client companies and each and every client.</p>

			<p>For each Coaching Team Engagement, I match the best executive coaches to each specific client company or program assignment
			paying attention not only to their coaching skill and experience, but also their relevant industry and specialty areas.
			Additionally,	I work directly with each coach to ensure that all have a comprehensive understanding of the context and goals of the
			specific coaching engagement, the culture and the needs of the organization as well as the specific needs of each participant that
			they are assigned. Just as in our individual Executive Coaching Engagements, the focus is always on supporting the client to step
			up and into their fullest potential, creating their quantum endeavor - living their great life doing their great work!</p>
